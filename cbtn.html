						Hey, I’m Chris, a designer from Oregon. I work at <a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/" target="_blank">CBT Nuggets</a>, helping people accomplish their dreams through online education. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> on Search and <a href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a> on their music apps before that. I’m passionate about building technology that changes people’s lives and designing experiences that are functional and beautiful.
